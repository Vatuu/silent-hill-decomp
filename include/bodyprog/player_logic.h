 * - 'func_800D2D2C' in map0_s00.c

 * The value changes during cutscenes when the player does any of the following
 * actions:
 * * 0 - Nothing
 * * 1 - Walking
 * * 3 - Moves to the right?
 * * 4 - Moves to the left
 * 
 * This behaviour is irregular. After the first in-game dialogue
 * with Harry, the value is kept as 1 (even when he is not walking or in
 * a cutscene) until the next dialogue triggers (when Harry sees
 * Cheryl and the second FMV plays). Something similar happens on the
 * next overlay where the value is 1 during the first
 * cutscene and doesn't change until the player makes an input.
