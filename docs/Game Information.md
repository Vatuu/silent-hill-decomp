# Game Information
A collection of all sorts of relevant information regarding the setup, dependencies, environment, etc. of the game.

## SDK

- Psy-Q Version: 4.3.0 - seems to be correct, based on https://github.com/lab313ru/psx_psyq_signatures

## Libraries

- Sound library `libsd`, supporting custom Konami `KDT1` MIDI files, also seen in the unreleased Konami International Rally Racing, Silent Hill 2's SOUNDCD.IRX and SOUNDHD.IRX files also seem based around the same library.

- Math library, contains custom `sin`/`cos` lookup-table implementation along with several `RotMatrix` functions.

- Movie player `MOVIESYS`, based on slightly customized Psy-Q SDK sample code, used across several Konami PSX titles along with the non-playable SLED-01774 SH1 demo disc.

## File Formats

Game makes use of custom file formats for models/cutscenes/levels, more information in [File Formats](/docs/File%20Formats.md) document.

### Unknown Releases

- A `SCPS-45380` release for Hong Kong/Asia was also produced, but has only been pictured inside sealed packaging, did this include a normal JP disc inside it, or was it a special release? (release date was apparently around 1999-04)
- Earliest known scene release is `Silent_Hill_USA_PAL_NTSC_Patch-PARADOX` from 1999-02-05, dated ~2 weeks after "Silent Hill Beta (U)", but 6 days prior to US v1.1 creation date - could they release a patch for a game only 2 weeks after it was produced? or was this for even earlier release?
- Earliest JP scene release is `Silent_Hill_JAP_Final-DVNpSX` from 1999-05-01, 1 month prior to JP Rev. 1. `Final` implies this was meant to replace an earlier non-final release (the group never used `Final` in other releases), but at this point JP Rev. 0 was the only known release, was there an earlier release this was meant to replace?
- Scene history for 1998 is very incomplete (dat listing sites only show 8 releases for the whole year), could be other releases that we're missing information about.
