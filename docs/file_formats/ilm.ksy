  ILM is the 3D model format used for skeletal characters in Silent Hill.
  The base format is LM.

  Mesh names store bone indices in the first two `char`s and bone names in the
  remaining `char`s. Bone meshes are stored untransformed and the ANM format is
  necessary to render the model correctly.
